#fed-maps
Handy little page that displays the [Fed2](http://federation2.com/) planet maps and system map in one place

##How to use
If you're familiar with Git, you can just clone the repository and open up `index.html` in your favorite web browser. If you're not familiar with Git, just hit that green button on the project page that says "clone or download" and then "Download ZIP", extract that ZIP anywhere you choose and open the `index.html` file, and you're set.

##I thought you said this thing shows planet maps!
You need to use the dropdown box on the right side to tell it which planet map to show.
